The costs associated with AV livestream teams are often not justified by the low numbers of live watchers. At the same time, we want to offer a multi-tasking allowing exp for attendees, even when WIFI is at low bandwidth. \n\n## Link to public GitHub repo (if applicable)\n\n## Link to demo website (if applicable)\nhttps://radio-theherd-studio.vercel.app/wip\n## How is Livepeer used for this project?\nWhile audio-only doesn't really need transcoding, the Livepeer network is a fundamental distribution protocol for the hi-quality audio signal. We are currently using LP for this task, but aiming at using it even more in the future by mapping audience's \"clap\" response to .ts segments of the streams, in order to provide detailed feeds, and integrate LPStudio for anyone to create their own web3 radio.\n\n## How will you improve your project with this grant? What steps will you take to meet this objective?\ntheHerd.Radio is currently in a product dev stage which will display the full feature dapp as the official radio for EthCC VII Bruxelles. A LP grant would allow us to go beyond our current dapp's scope and be able to interact even more with the orchestrator's events such as .ts segments, as well as allow full onchain music playlists, bids for sponsors in dapp.\n\n## Was this project started at a hackathon or another web3 event? Which one?\nnone. but a first MVP iteration of this project featured at ETHRome hackathon with radio.spaghett-eth.com \n\n## Please describe (in words) your team's relevant experience, and why you think you are the right team to build this project. You can cite your team's prior experience in similar domains, doing similar dev work, individual team members' backgrounds, etc.\nthe Herd Studio is a web3 creative dev-team serving the wider Stake Capital group with web3 pop-up solutions as well as event organizations (unStableSummit, La Degen, Rekt Party, EthCC). We operate at the highest intersection of the web3 ecosystem. Regarding decentralized AV media, we are in constant working relationship with the StreamETH and Beem teams.\n\n## What is the projectâ€™s expected deliverable at the conclusion of the grant time period?\na Full feature web3 radio dapp for EthCC VII Bruxelles.\nEventually, we might consider turning this into a protocol where users \n\n## What is the one thing (the core mechanic) you want someone to do when using your deliverable?\na browse-and-play web radio app, where users are given a web3 choice of creating a wallet using Cometh Connect and interacting with the current palimpsest.\n\n## How will this deliverable benefit the Livepeer ecosystem?\nWe believe LP has a yet undiscovered potential regarding audio-only streams. We would like to be amongst the ambassadors of this vertical, and in time support LP in spinning its protocol to more audio-related services.\n\n## How did you learn about the Livepeer Grants Program?\nWe have been using LP for livestreams since 2018.\n"}]'
